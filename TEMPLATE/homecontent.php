		<h1>I hate Lorem Ipsum</h1>
		<p>
			Lorem ipsum is clouding the design proces. When you shuffle meaningless words into a design it is way too easy to make it look beautiful.
			Make no mistake, beautiful is important, but the designer can choose the exactly right font size to get the balance she wants and just cut or add lorem ipsum to make it fit.
			Eventually the right text arrives and happens to be much too short or 50% longer than the random choice of lorem.

		<p>How to avoid it? So simple: You just need to have your content ready before you finish your design.</p>
